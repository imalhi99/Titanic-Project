Titanic Survival Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. We explore classification, resampling, and clustering methods to determine the best approach for prediction. 
📊 Dataset
•	Source: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuofxz/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster
•	Description: Passenger demographic and ticket information, along with survival outcomes.
❓ Key Questions
•	What factors influenced passenger survival the most?
•	How accurately can machine learning predict survival?
•	How do different models compare in performance?
🚀 Methods Used
🔹 Data Preprocessing
•	Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
•	Feature engineering (FamilySize, categorical encoding)
•	Normalized numerical features
🔹 Machine Learning Models
1.	Logistic Regression - Baseline classification model
2.	Random Forest - Ensemble learning for better accuracy
3.	K-Means Clustering - Unsupervised learning for pattern discovery
🔹 Model Evaluation
•	Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
•	Feature importance analysis
•	Clustering visualization
📈 Results Summary
✅ Random Forest performed best (81% accuracy) 
✅ Key survival factors: Gender, class, fare 
✅ K-Means clustering showed passenger groupings by ticket class and fare 
  ❗   Limitations: Dataset size, historical bias
